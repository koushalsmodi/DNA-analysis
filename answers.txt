Sum count:  39840

Explanation:
For test-high-gc-1.fastq, the sum received was 39840 while for the  total_count and length of sequence, the answer obtained was 40000.

Write at least one paragraph describing how you approach this detective work 

When approaching the detective work of comparing the metrics for the .fastq files, the first step is to understand the code and its logic. 
By examining the code, I identified the different variables and calculations involved in computing the metrics. 
This helped me in understanding how the individual counts, total_count, and seq length are derived and how they relate to each other.
To identify the differences between the metrics, I then compared their values for each file. 
By comparing the sum of individual counts, total_count, and seq length, I determined whether they are equal or different.


Write at least one paragraph to explain the differences 

The differences between the sum of individual counts and the total_count/seq length metrics can occur due to various factors. 
Firstly,  the presence of characters other than A, C, G, and T in the sequence, which are counted in total_count/seq length but not in the individual counts. 
Variations in the way the sequence is represented, such as line breaks or whitespace characters, which may affect the length calculation but not the individual counts. 
Potential errors or inconsistencies in the input file, such as missing or extra characters, which can affect the total_count/seq length but not the individual counts if they are not A, C, G, or T.


Write at least one paragraph which total(s) can be used to calculate GC content and which total(s) cannot.

For calculating the GC content, the sum of individual counts of G and C can be used as the numerator, and the sum of A, C, G and T can be used as denominator. Since it will cover up for any input file formatting as it will contain only valid nucleotide characters to obtain accurate results.

We should not calculate the GC content, using either the total_count or the length of the sequence (len(seq)) as the denominator as it may contain line breaks, whitespaces, or extra characters.
